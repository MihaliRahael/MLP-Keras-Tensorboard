## A Study on MLP, Tensorboard & Keras Libraries
This repository has the study of several architectures, layers of MLP models using Keras API.
Notes covers the concepts of several activation units, Batch Normalisation, Dropouts, Softmax classifier etc.

One note researches through the visualizations provided by Tensorboard tool for several parameters on Machine Leanring experimentation.
